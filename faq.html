                    <p>Safety is our top priority! We have certified wilderness first aid instructors and a nurse on site. Minor scrapes and bruises happen, but we've never had a serious incident. <span class="corrupted-inline">Well, not since 1967.</span></p>

                    <p>For your safety, please stay within marked trails and designated areas. The old cabin ruins beyond the east trail are off-limits - the structures are unstable. <span class="warning-text">The lodge management asks that you do not enter this area under any circumstances.</span></p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Pinewood Valley Lodge was established in 1952 as an educational retreat. Thousands of students have enjoyed the beauty of this location over the decades! The valley itself is much older, of course - the indigenous peoples considered it sacred ground. <span class="hidden-text-reveal">Some said it was a place where the veil between worlds grows thin.</span></p>
