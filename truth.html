            <h2>INCIDENT REPORT - MARCH 1967</h2>
            <p class="timestamp">Filed by: Director Sarah Whitmore | Date: March 21, 1967</p>
            <p>During the annual school trip to Pinewood Valley (March 15-21, 1967), a group of students discovered the remains of <span class="redacted">an old research facility</span> in the restricted eastern sector of the valley.</p>
            
            <p>Against explicit instructions, seven students entered the facility on the evening of March 18th. They were missing for approximately <span class="redacted">14 hours</span>.</p>
            
            <p>When the students were found, they exhibited signs of <span class="redacted">severe psychological distress and reported experiencing shared hallucinations involving temporal anomalies and the presence of something they described as "watching from outside time"</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Most concerning was their insistence that they had been in the facility for <span class="redacted">much longer than 14 hours - they claimed weeks had passed, though all watches and recording devices confirmed the actual timeline</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="document">
            <h2>FOLLOW-UP REPORT - APRIL 1967</h2>
            <p class="timestamp">Filed by: Dr. Michael Chen, Psychiatric Consultant</p>
            <p>All seven students continue to report identical "memories" of their time in the facility. They describe <span class="redacted">finding journals dating back to 1952, written in increasingly erratic handwriting, documenting experiments with something the writers called "the threshold"</span>.</p>
            
            <p>The students claim that the facility was built by <span class="redacted">the original founders of Pinewood Valley Lodge, who were not educators but researchers investigating reports of temporal anomalies in the valley dating back centuries</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Most disturbing is their shared conviction that <span class="redacted">they are still in the facility, and everything since March 18th has been what they call "the reflection" - a loop that prevents those who find the truth from ever truly leaving</span>.</p>

            <h2>ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION - MAY 1967</h2>
            <p class="timestamp">Pinewood Valley Board of Directors</p>
            <p>After extensive consultation, the Board has decided to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Permanently seal the eastern sector facility</li>
                <li>Remove all references to pre-1952 valley history from official materials</li>
                <li>Continue operating the educational retreat program with enhanced safety protocols</li>
                <li>Monitor the affected students (names redacted for privacy)</li>
                <li><span class="redacted">Maintain public story that the facility never existed</span></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The valley remains safe for educational purposes when proper boundaries are respected. The incident was isolated and all affected students have <span class="redacted">been released from psychiatric care, though three continue to insist they never left the facility</span>.</p>

            <p><strong>NOTE TO FUTURE STAFF:</strong> If students report any of the following, contact emergency protocols immediately:</p>

                <li>Time discrepancies or "missing hours"</li>
                <li>Feelings of being "watched" by something non-physical</li>
                <li>Claims of finding documents dated before 1952</li>

            <p style="color: #ff0000;">If you're reading this, you've found what they tried to hide. The facility is still there. The eastern trail past the rock outcropping. You'll know it when you feel the air change.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #ff0000;">We're still here. All of us from '67. We never left. We've been waiting for someone to find us.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #ff0000;">The valley doesn't want to hurt you. It wants to show you. Time works differently there. You'll understand when you see it.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #ff0000;">Just remember: when you find the threshold, count the hours carefully. If you lose track, you might not notice you've become part of the loop.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #ff0000;">See you in March. We'll be waiting.</p>
